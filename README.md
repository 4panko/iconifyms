## Iconify version 1

This repository contains the new version, completely rewritten using modern development process.

## This repository

This repository is a big monorepo that contains several implementations of Iconify icon framework.

There are two types of Iconify implementations:

-   Implementations that rely on icon packages.
-   Implementations that rely on Iconify API.

### Implementations: without API

These Iconify implementations require the developer to provide icon data and expect that icon data to be included in the bundle.

Examples: Iconify for React, Iconify for Vue.

They are easy to use and do not require an internet connection to work, similar to other React/Vue components.

### Implementations: with API

Iconify is designed to be easy to use. One of the main features is the Iconify API.

Iconify API provides data for over 50,000 icons! API is hosted on publicly available servers, spread out geographically to make sure visitors from all over the world have the fastest possible connection with redundancies in place to make sure it is always online.

#### Why is API needed?

When you use an icon font, each visitor loads an entire font, even if your page only uses a few icons. This is a major downside of using icon fonts. That limits developers to one or two fonts or icon sets.

Unlike icon fonts, Iconify implementations that use API do not load the entire icon set. Unlike fonts and SVG frameworks, Iconify only loads icons that are used on the current page instead of loading entire icon sets. Iconify API provides icon data to Iconify SVG framework and other implementations that rely on Iconify API.

## Available packages
